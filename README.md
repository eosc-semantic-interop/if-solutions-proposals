# if-solutions-proposals

## about

This repository allows to discuss and write up new ideas "proposals" for increasing "interoperability" in the [EOSC](https://eosc.eu) domain through the application of semantic-web-techniques.

Proposals that mature up to actual solutions are expected to get listed up in the [catalog](https://eosc-semantic-interop.github.io/if-solutions-catalog/)

## how to proceed

Feel welcome and invited.

Liberally engage with the ongoing proposals here through issues, pull requests and commits.

Dare to start your own proposal-subfolder and trigger some collaboration around it.
