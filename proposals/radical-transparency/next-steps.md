## TODO list

* start on a reference implementation making the case tangible
  * Conformance detection script 
  * Possibly deploy as web-tool too (javascript / typescript?)
* consider a basic profile registry 
  * simple design for csv / rdf uplifting / harvesting and chaining
  * consider / allow deploy inside sage project
  * idea to reuse an earlier create ro-profile registry for this
* keep an eye on the CDIF link in this initiative 
  * namely open issues [#14](https://github.com/Cross-Domain-Interoperability-Framework/cdifbook/issues/14) and [#15](https://github.com/Cross-Domain-Interoperability-Framework/cdifbook/issues/15)
* deepen how the [FIP work](https://fip.fair-wizard.com/wizard) can fit with this (both attempting to bring data- and evidence-driven techniques into the interop work)
  * FIP leads in this aspect already, and will sure remain relevant to cover the influx and coverage of the "non-automated" side of things
  * While this RT stuff could add (through automation) a broader coverage
* reach out broader for more feedback and possible collaboration / adoption
  * ask to get this topic scheduled in the sage-techy-talks
  * ask to get tthis in the eosc-semantic-interop group
* eye open on recent dataspace / w3c efforts
  * [w3c dataspaces cg](https://w3c-cg.github.io/dataspaces/)
  * [SDS26](https://dbis.rwth-aachen.de/SDS26/)
